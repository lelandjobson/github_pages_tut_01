# Future Craft Field Guides

Sandbox for [Pratt Itl](https://itl.pratt.edu) Field Guides
website using Markdown and git.

## How to contribute

### Editing an existing page
- In the **pages** folder, go to the field guide folder you want to edit
- Click on the appropriate page file (.md file) that you want to edit.
- 
### Creating a new page
- If you want to add a new page, add it to said folder with the extension .md (Ex. introduction.md)
- You will need to add a header to the file, which we call the "front matter" (metadata about the page) that is **critical** to the pages functionality. It lets our compiler know where to add the page in the field guide, the pages layout, the pages title and description, and what order the page ought to go in. Front matter looks like this:
```
---
layout: post
title: Image Types
description: A top level introduction to the adobe suite and its products.
field-guide: Adobe Field Guide
order: 1
---
```
**layout: post** Do not change this.
