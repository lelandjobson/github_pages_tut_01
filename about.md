We believe that technology, technique, craft and reason interlink our various disciplines. Our mission is to bootstrap the learning process within the creative arts and broaden the technical prowess of students and practitioners through a free and open source medium.

Since our formation in 2011 as the Digital Futures Group through our transition into the ITL, we have purveyed over one hundred digital seminars and provided a decade of service in the forms of creating, curating, delivering and supporting educational content and initiatives within the School of Architecture. In our tenure, we consistently maintained that the tenets of digital craftsmanship are immutable: lessons in design software outlast their manifestations.

We have come to believe that the ultimate user manual for implementing technology in creative work is not only writable, but the resources and talent to do so are already at our grasp.

This project, called the Future Craft Field Guides, or FCFG for short, are the consolidation of our knowledge base: technologyâ€™s manifold implementations in the arts are keyframed at the macro and micro levels, spanning from fundamentals to content creation. On its face, the Field Guide serves to broaden the technical prowess of our students, but our project is to also discover how technology, technique, craft and reason interlink our various disciplines - if we could draw that web, what would we learn? What could we do with it? FCFG is such an  asset.
