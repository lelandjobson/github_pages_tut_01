# Style & Asset Creation Guide

This guide shows:

- Content Types

- How to create and add a document to the FCFG
- How to structure your content

- How to make image assets using our Rhino template file
- How to make 3D sketchfab assets for the guide
- How to push the update to the FCFG



## Basic Setup

In order to begin working on the guide, you will need three pieces of software:

- Rhinoceros 6
- [Typora](https://typora.io/#download)
- Github Desktop



#### Clone the Repository 

Next, we'll need to copy the field guide to your device. Navigate to our [Github Repository](http://www.github.com). Hit the **Clone or Download** button. Hit ***Open With Desktop***. This will launch **Github Desktop**. 

Save the repository to your computer (I recommend the My Documents/Github folder). If you are using a Mac, save it whichever folder Github Desktop defaults to.

![githubCLone](C:\Users\Leland Jobson\Documents\GitHub\github_pages_tut_01\internal\styleguide\images\githubCLone.PNG)



All this did was download the contents of the Field Guides to your machine at he specified folder with a special file that tracks changes on the document. By using this special system, called Git, we can track updates and revisions on the Field Guide.



#### Open this page in Typora 

Lets find this webpage in Typora. It is located in the Field Guide at **Internal/styleguide/**. You will find a file and a folder:

- The styleguide.md file, which contains all of the decorated text and image references for the webpage
- The image folder, which contains all of the static images for the webpage



As you can see, this webpage is as easy to edit as a google doc. Have a look around, then move on to the next step of this guide.



## Content Types 

This website contains four classes of information:

- Field Guides 
  - Projects
    - Processes
      - Principles
      - Platforms



### Field Guides

Field guides are collections of all other types of information. They guide the reader into becoming proficient at a skillset, through a combination of directed exercises (Projects), walkthroughs of concepts and applications of platforms.

*Example: Field Guide to the Adobe Suite.*



### Projects

Projects contain Processes, Platforms, and Platforms. They are directed exercises in creating something. *Example: How to Create a Holographic Poster with Illustrator*



### Processes

Processes contain principles and platforms. They are workflows that can be implemented in a number of projects. 

*Example: How to delete duplicate lines in Illustrator*



### Principles

Principles are platform-agnostic ideas, concepts, truths and entities. 

*Examples: List Sorting, Beveling*



###  Platforms

Platforms are the arenas in / means by which work is accomplished, including both hardware and software. *Examples: UR10, QGIS, Illustrator, Indesign*





## Creating A Document



First, copy  a template file from one of the folders below to start your document. Never start with a blank page!

- templates/process.md <- For processes
- templates/project.md <- For projects
- template/fieldguide.md <- For field guides
- template/platform.md <- For platforms
- template/principle.md <- For principles



Create  a path for your content within the **pages/** folder for your content under the appropriate folder. This path directly correlates to the URL of the webpage which is automatically generated by the compiler.



### Front Matter

Each template has a different *front matter*, which is code written at the top of the document that tells our compiler a number of things:

- The name of the content
- What the thumbnail image of the content is (in lieu of a sketchfab model)
- What the sketchfab thumbnail image of the content is (in lieu of an image)
- The author(s) of the content
- A basic description of the content
- What category it is a part of (principles/processes/etc.)
- What subcategory it is a part of within that category
- What dependencies, or other content, should be read in order to help understand this content
- What platforms this content is relevant to



An example of front matter for one of our Process articles is below:

```yaml
layout: process
title: Surface Panelization
category: Processes
subcategory: Discretization
description: How to turn a 3d surface into discrete panels.
dependencies: [ 'Lines' ]
platforms: [ 'Rhinoceros','Grasshopper' ]
order: 0
```



Each template has its own front matter template. Be sure to fill out **all** of this information before submitting the content, otherwise it may not appear correctly online.
