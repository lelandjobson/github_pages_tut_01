![](.\images\curvature_analysis.PNG)



An analysis in Rhinoceros reveals the gaussian curvature of the first surface in this set. Not only is this surface not planar, but it is also not **developable**, meaning that it cannot be flattened onto a plane without distortion, and a flat material can't be used to reconstitute this shape exactly.

Planar geometries are generally **easier to fabricate**, as **material stock is often planar**.

A faceted hemisphere is **unrolled** into flat, planar panels for fabrication.
