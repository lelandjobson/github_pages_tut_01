Ellipses contain two **foci** (singular: focus). Ellipses share a property that the sum of the distances from each focus to the edge of the ellipse is constant across all points of the ellipse - in a sense, it is a "radius" formed by two points.

All circles are ellipses but not all ellipses are circles.

An ellipse can be derived also from a **conic section**, with a titled plane.
